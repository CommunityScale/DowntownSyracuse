					<p>Downtown has had explosive growth since 2015, including adding higher income households.</p>
					<p>Single-person households and seniors living alone are strong growth areas and could be targeted with new units that meet their needs and preferences.</p>
					<p>All of Onondaga County is a 20-30 minute drive from Downtown, making it the de facto market area for analysis and the primary draw area from which to attract new residents to downtown housing. The County region added 9,000 households since 2020. As the County region continues to grow for the next 5 years, a portion of that growth could be attracted to live downtown if the right units, amenities, lifestyle are available.</p>
					<p>Since 2019, 50% of residents who moved to Downtown Syracuse came from outside of Onondaga County, so the analysis should also consider opportunities to attract more residents and investment from beyond Onondaga County.</p>

				</div>
				<!-- Main Content Row -->
				<div class="twelve columns" style="margin-top: 2%; margin-left: 0;">
					<p><i>What housing types are missing Downtown?</i></p>
                    <ul><li>The deepest pools of demand and capture rate indicate that the most demanded housing types are rental apartments between $1,500-$2,000 that are studios or 1 beds, with some demand for 2 beds.</li></ul>
					<p><i>What amenities should be recommended to developers of housing units?</i></p>
                    <ul><li>Residents and property managers report that requested amenities include mail storage and parcel room, bicycle storage room, roof deck with functional use, parking, fitness center, smaller units with natural light and eat-in kitchens that are easy to furnish.</li></ul>
					<p><i>How much more demand is there for specific types of housing and does this keep Downtown at a healthy occupancy rate?</i></p>
                    <ul><li>Given this strong market demand and fast absorption rates, if 176 new units were delivered annually, Downtown should maintain a healthy vacancy rate of under 7%.</li></ul>
                    <p><i>How does the ReZone Syracuse initiative affect housing in Downtown?</i></p>
                    <ul><li>The ReZone initiative, particularly the MX-5 zoning for Downtown, is highly favorable for housing development. It removes traditional constraints like maximum building heights, minimum lot sizes, and minimum parking requirements, offering flexibility for dense residential projects. It also mandates that new and substantially renovated multifamily projects with 20 or more units designate 10-12% of units as affordable (at 80% AMI).</li></ul>
                    <p><i>Who is primarily moving to Downtown Syracuse?</i></p>
                    <ul><li>Recent growth in Downtown has been largely driven by householders aged 25-44, who accounted for 62% of the growth since 2015. Notably, 50% of residents who moved to Downtown between 2019 and 2023 came from outside Onondaga County, indicating Downtown's appeal to newcomers to the region.</li></ul>

					<h3>Establishing the context for Downtown’s housing market potential and need</h3>
                    <p>Downtown Syracuse's housing future is shaped by several critical factors:</p>
				</div>
				<!-- Main Content Row -->
				<div class="seven columns" style="margin-top: 2%; margin-left: 0;">
                    <h5><strong>Downtown's strategic importance in planning</strong></h5>
					<p>Regional and city plans consistently identify Downtown Syracuse as a vital center for growth, emphasizing mixed-use development and leveraging major investments to meet future housing needs. Recent comprehensive planning efforts by both the City of Syracuse and Onondaga County, alongside multiple housing studies and a dedicated housing taskforce by CenterState CEO, consistently underscore the strategic importance of Downtown Syracuse for regional growth and vitality. These plans collectively recognize Downtown as a key hub for employment, culture, and increasingly, residential living.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Emphasis on mixed use and density:</strong> Plans like the Syracuse Comprehensive Plan (2012-2040) and Plan Onondaga advocate for high-density, mixed-use development in Downtown, encouraging residential units above ground-floor commercial spaces to boost walkability and economic activity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Leveraging major investments:</strong> All plans highlight the transformative potential of the Micron investment and the I-81 viaduct removal. They see these projects as catalysts for increased housing demand and opportunities to strategically guide new development, particularly in and around Downtown, to accommodate workforce needs and reconnect the urban fabric. The County Housing Needs Assessment (2024) specifically anticipates 20,000-25,000 new households county-wide by 2040 due to Micron, positioning Downtown to capture a significant share with appropriate housing stock.</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus on strong centers:</strong> Plan Onondaga and the County Housing Needs Assessment emphasize directing investment towards established "strong centers," including Downtown Syracuse, to promote sustainable growth patterns and leverage existing infrastructure.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5><strong>ReZone's favorable regulatory framework</strong></h5>
					<p>The recent ReZone initiative builds on the flexible MX-5 zoning (no height/lot size limits), creating significant opportunities for dense residential development.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ReZone Syracuse (2024) initiative represents a comprehensive overhaul of the city’s outdated zoning laws. The new ordinance allows for denser, mixed-use development, expanding housing options in traditionally single-family neighborhoods, and implementing affordable housing requirements in large developments. Additionally, ReZone promotes and encourages residential units above commercial spaces.</li>
                        <li>ReZone is the most recent impactful planning step towards creating housing opportunities in Downtown, and because the rezoning is so recent it is yet to be seen how impactful the changes are. The MX-5 designation removes traditional constraints like maximum building heights, minimum lot sizes, and minimum parking requirements offering developers flexibility to pursue dense, high-rise residential projects that maximize land use. <strong>This permissive environment is crucial for accommodating future growth.</strong></li>
                        <li>ReZone has an inclusionary zoning requirement: new and substantially renovated multifamily projects with 20 or more units must designate 10-12% of units as affordable to households earning up to 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI), which was $104,100 according to HUD in 2025.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5><strong>Micron's major economic catalyst</strong></h5>
					<p>The upcoming Micron facility is projected to generate over 50,000 direct and indirect jobs regionally, creating substantial new housing demand that Downtown is well-positioned to help absorb.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The 2022 Economic Analysis for the Micron complex of chip plants outlines a massive economic transformation for Onondaga County, with significant implications for housing and workforce needs in Downtown Syracuse. The report projects that Micron’s complex will generate 9,005 permanent direct jobs at the chip plants by 2045​. The total number of additional jobs by 2055 is estimated to be 50,911 jobs statewide, with 44,943 in Central New York​ (9,005 permanent positions and 41,904 indirect and induced additional jobs).</li>
                        <li>The ripple effects of this employment boom will increase housing demand throughout the region, particularly in areas with proximity to Micron. The county’s population is projected to grow by nearly 60,000 people during this period, further intensifying the need for additional housing supply.</li>
                        <li>Downtown Syracuse’s role in absorbing this growth is twofold. First, Downtown is likely to have satellite offices and indirect and induced office jobs as a key employment hub. Second, Downtown offers a uniquely walkable and urban lifestyle within 15 miles of the fabrication facilities and as such will be a preferred location for future residents in that market.</li>
                        <li>This Housing Needs Assessment uses the 2022 report’s Table 2.3 Population Impacts for Central New York to estimate the additional household needs per year for the next five years. With this approach, the analysis forecasts 12,041 additional units of housing demand in Onondaga & Cayuga Counties, translating to an average total demand of <strong>191 housing units in Downtown annually.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5><strong>I-81's transformative infrastructure project (I-81)</strong></h5>
					<p>Replacing the I-81 viaduct with the Community Grid will unlock approximately 18 acres of developable land and significantly improve connections to adjacent neighborhoods and institutions, enhancing Downtown's attractiveness for new housing investment.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Community Grid design will reconnect neighborhoods that have been separated since the viaduct's construction. The project will upgrade a portion of Interstate 481, which would be re-designated as I-81, and construct the new Business Loop 81 along Almond Street to improve connections to Downtown and adjacent neighborhoods.</li>
                        <li>The project includes reconstruction of the Almond Street corridor with sidewalks, shared-use paths, and the potential for newly developable land. From the perspective of the Downtown, there are two first-order impacts of the grounding. First, vacant land on the eastern side of Downtown will be more attractive for development without the nuisance of the viaduct. Second, the accessibility to and from University Hill to the east will be improved, opening Downtown as an improved option for staff and student housing.</li>
                </ul>

                            Downtown’s growth reflects a resurgence in urban living and residential investment driven mostly by adaptive reuse.<br>

                            The dramatic spikes in Downtown’s income levels are likely associated with the fact that the number of households has been increasing rapidly but from a low starting point, so there is a larger margin of error on the counts.<br>

					<h4>Threats and weaknesses</h4>
					<ul>
                        <li>Most of the opportunities for renovation of historic Downtown buildings into residential uses have already been undertaken. Downtown should avoid policies that directly lead to the further conversion of remaining office uses to residential to remain a mixed-use district. Adaptive reuse of historic buildings has been prevalent, often utilizing tax credits, but <strong>opportunities may be diminishing without more low-hanging fruit.</strong></li>
					    <li>Cost is a hurdle for construction of new residential buildings (instead of adaptive reuse). Stakeholders reported per-unit construction costs between $250K and $300K per unit for rental apartments. Further skilled labor shortages may be caused by I-81 grounding, development on University Hill, and construction at Micron using the regional capacity.</li>
                        <li>There are about 2,000 multifamily units currently going through permitting Citywide, of which 500 are in Downtown. While some of those are student housing, Downtown will be in competition with the Inner Harbor redevelopment and adjoining Franklin Square. These other neighborhoods may command top of the market rents for urban living, which is a relatively small overall portion of the market.</li>
					    <li>Quality of life issues for Downtown, including perception of security, parking for residents, and neighborhood amenities impact the potential pool of residents.</li>

					<h4>Strengths and opportunities</h4>
					<ul>
                        <li>Downtown offers an urban lifestyle that is unique to the area, including walkability and the cultural amenities including Redhouse Arts Center and Landmark Theatre.</li>
					    <li><strong>Rezone for Downtown is very permissive</strong> and hasn't been fully explored. The zoning's new 10-12% inclusionary zoning requirement is generally seen as manageable because the rent discount is relatively close to market rate given the regional median income.</li>
                        <li>The region is growing but not building enough housing, leading to the region's first ever housing shortage. According to CenterState CEO, the region needs around 3,000 homes a year but is only delivering 1,000 homes. <strong>If housing can be built in Downtown, this regional shortage will bolster demand.</strong></li>
					    <li>The City wants to see projects get built and has invested in a more predictable permitting process. There is also no pushback from the community regarding new buildings.</li>
                        <li>Grounding I-81 will make vacant parcels in eastern Downtown more attractive with potential for new housing development.</li>
                        <li>Employers are reporting housing demand beyond what is available on the market, more demand due to to return-to-office, and culture among younger employees to want to be in the office.</li>

					<p>The Downtown Syracuse rental market is experiencing high demand, particularly for 1-bedroom units and studios, leading to low vacancy rates. This tight rental market suggests there is pent-up demand for more apartments.</p>
                    <p>Despite this demand, renters are budget-conscious, showing resistance to higher price points, which has resulted in concessions. The optimal pricing appears to be between $1,000-$1,300 (around $2.00/sf) for these smaller units, as 2-bedroom units priced at $2,300 face pushback. </p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, Downtown Syracuse presents a significant opportunity for rental growth without risk of saturation, fueled by increasing regional demand and limited new construction. </p>
                    <p>Residents are price sensitive to a degree, but the following amenities may make the building more attractive and achieve higher rents:</p>
					<ul>
                        <li>Mail storage and parcel room</li>
                        <li>Bicycle storage room</li>

				<div class="five columns" style="margin-top: 2%; margin-left: 0;">
					<p>As residential becomes a larger share of Downtown's overall land use, it is important to reconceptualize Downtown as a neighborhood and to consider factors that would improve livability and quality of life as Downtown's main competitive advantage. According to a survey of employees working Downtown, the most attractive parts of living Downtown are walkability and short commutes. However, the drawbacks include perceived safety risks and lack of access to certain expected neighborhood amenities.</p>
					<p>The following areas should be prioritized:</p>
					<ul>
                        <li><strong>Grocery Store and Pharmacy:</strong> Downtown residents have access to a Wegmans within a 10-minute drive, Syracuse Cooperative Market for smaller purchases, and DGX. Nevertheless, if Downtown is going to grow, a full-size supermarket and pharmacy would improve the neighborhood's attractiveness.</li>
                        <li><strong>More than drinks after work:</strong> Downtown should match the diverse lifestyle preferences of a younger workforce. Employer interviews reveal demand for fitness studios, late‑night cafés, and other amenities that reflect the next generation’s work‑life rhythm alongside traditional bars and restaurants.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dog-Friendly Downtown Initiative:</strong> Given the repeated mentions of dog owners' needs, consider a public-private partnership to establish a dog park or other dog-friendly amenities in the Downtown area.</li>

					<p>There is a demonstrated market potential for an additional 176 units annually for the next five years, of which 166 are for rental and 10 are for ownership condo, covered on the next page. While there is less available “low-hanging fruit” from Historic Tax Credit-funded adaptive reuse, new construction on underutilized land is attractive, especially on the eastern side of Downtown as I-81 grounding improves the area’s attractiveness.</p>
                    <p>To capitalize on this strong demand and ensure rapid absorption of new units, developers should strategically align their projects with the specific housing types, sizes, price points, and amenities that resonate most with current and prospective Downtown residents.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Prioritize Smaller Units:</strong> The deepest pools of demand are for studio and 1-bedroom rental apartments with some demand for 2-bedroom units.</li>
                        <li><strong>Target Optimal Rental Rates:</strong> The most demanded rental apartments fall between $1,500-$2,000 per month. While residents show price sensitivity, newly constructed units built since 2021 are achieving an average of $3.28 per square foot.</li>
                        <li><strong>Design for Livability:</strong> Units should be designed to be easy to furnish, maximizing natural light and incorporating features like eat-in kitchens. Other desired amenities include secure mail storage and a dedicated parcel room, a bicycle storage room, a roof deck, and convenient parking options on-site or nearby.</li>

					<p>Although the for-sale condo segment is considerably smaller than Downtown’s rental market, it can comfortably absorb roughly 10 new units per year over the next five years. Downtown’s buyer pool is thinner because most recent movers are renters and many owner-occupants in the region still prefer larger 3- and 4-bedroom homes. Even so, past transactions show that purchasers will pay a premium for Downtown’s walkable, job-proximate lifestyle: recent sales have reached $359 per sq ft. At or near that price point, new construction can cover today’s construction, land, and financing costs and still pencil, making a limited pipeline of well-designed condos financially viable.</p>
					<p>The Downtown condo market niches primarily cater to professionals seeking urban convenience and downsizing seniors desiring a low-maintenance lifestyle, with potential interest from long-term or international graduate or medical students. To capture this niche, focus on compact 1- and 2-bedroom plans with flexible layouts that can double as work-from-home space.</p>
                    <p>A by-right mid-rise market rate condo development on a small parcel would take full advantage of MX-5’s lack of height, density, or parking requirements and would be strategically positioned to meet Downtown’s limited but reliable condo demand while maintaining healthy margins.</p>

Improvements should be made from the perspective of a Downtown visitor that removes the friction and intimidation of parking. Syracuse may want to consider attracting a valet service operator to meet potential demand.</p>
                    <p>SMTC’s (Syracuse Metropolitan Transportation Council) <i>Downtown Parking: Wayfinding and Signage Guide</i> recommends a district‑wide rollout of standardized public‑parking and bicycle‑parking signage will solve one of the core perception problem: visitors and prospective residents believe parking is scarce when, in fact, more than 11,000 publicly available spaces and multiple under‑utilized garages already exist. By making those assets visible, such as at the Trolley Lot, and City Center Garage, developers can confidently deliver new mixed‑income projects under MX‑5’s zero‑minimum‑parking rules, lowering construction costs while preserving ground floors for active uses. </p>
                    <p>Coupling wayfinding with the Guide’s proposed expansion of visible bike racks throughout Downtown will also support bicycle use for transportation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Exploit MX‑5 flexibility.</strong> Proactively market the height‑, parking‑, and lot‑size‑free zoning to national developers. Projects that meet the inclusionary affordable housing requirements should be fast‑tracked through the City’s new permitting process.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prioritize quality‑of‑life infrastructure.</strong> To expand Downtown’s attractiveness and capture rate, a full‑service grocery/pharmacy, a dog park, and fitness and late‑night café options will appeal to young professionals.</p>
					<p><strong>Own the 15‑minute commute story.</strong> Walkability was the number one reason why Downtown resident survey respondents choose to live in the neighborhood. With I-81 grounding, the commute to University Hill will be even more pleasant.</p>
					<p><strong>Make parking effortless.</strong> Implement SMTC’s standardized wayfinding and signage guidance so visitors and prospective residents experience parking as “easy,” reinforcing MX‑5’s zero‑minimum‑parking advantage.</p>
					<p><strong>Track and trumpet metrics on Downtown Stats.</strong> Publish updates on occupancy, rent growth, and retail foot‑traffic to reassure investors and adjust capture‑rate assumptions in real time.</p>
